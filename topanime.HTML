       <p class="ttex2">Two tickets to the highest-grossing anime movie of all time, please.
    Throughout the years, Japanese animation company Studio Ghibli has dominated the
     anime box office with feature films such as Princess Mononoke, Ponyo, Howl’s Moving Castle,
      and Spirited Away. These four movies are among the 10 highest-grossing anime movies
      worldwide and have grossed millions of dollars since their release.
    New contenders in the anime blockbuster scene, Makoto Shinkai’s works Your Name,
     Weathering With You, and Suzume no Tojimari are also on top of the charts.
    Films from shonen franchises like Jujutsu Kaisen, Demon Slayer, and One Piece are
     on the rise, all of which broke records during their respective premieres.
    From heartwarming tales of love and friendship to epic clashes between good and evil,
     each one is a story written to inspire. But you don’t have to be a magic-wielding
      badass to make a difference — even everyday heroes can rise up with small acts
       and change the lives of those they care about for the better.</p>

           Choo choo! All aboard the Mugen money train!
    Ufotable’s Demon Slayer Mugen Train is the highest-grossing anime movie of all time.
    The film follows the manga’s Mugen Train arc, featuring the Kamado siblings, their
    friends, and the Flame Hashira, Kyokuro Rengoku. The group is on a hunt to find a
     dangerous demon aboard the Mugen Train, while defending the 200 passengers onboard.
    Despite being released at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the movie
     broke records and became the highest-grossing Japanese film of all time with more
      than US$506 million in earnings. In fact, it beat Spirited Away’s 19-year record
      after grossing US$223 million just over two months after its release.
    The film received high praise for its gorgeous visuals and top-tier animation,
    particularly its enthralling fight scenes.
    Anime fans can watch the full Demon Slayer Mugen Train movie on Netflix.

     and accidentally stumbles upon the spirit world. Later on, she meets a boy named Haku
      who helps her find a way out of the spiritual dimension.

       Perhaps the most-loved Makoto Shinkai film of our generation, Your Name centers
        on the mundane lives of a high school boy living in Tokyo named Taki Tachibana
        and a high school girl in the countryside named Mitsuha Miyamizu. One fateful day,
         the two inexplicably begin to switch bodies.
    During its first few weeks at the Japanese box office, Your Name held the top spot
    for several consecutive weekends. It grossed US$160 million in 2016 according to Oricon News,
     besting international titles in the country such as Star Wars: The Force Awakens,
