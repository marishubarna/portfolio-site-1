<h1 class="tit1">ANIME</h1>
<p class="text1">Anime (アニメ) is a Japanese shorthand for the English word "animation",
   which is pronounced animēshon in Japanese . It means animated film , except
    that in Japan the term is used to describe all animated films and series,
     regardless of their country of origin. Outside of Japan, the word anime is
      used to describe Japanese animated films and the style of Japanese animation  .
      A theory about the origin of the term anime from the French word animé
      (animated) or les dessins animés (animated images) is debatable.
       Both forms - the original animēshon and the shortened anime - are used by
        the Japanese.
        Everyone knows that a subculture is a special sphere of culture, a
        sovereign integral formation within the dominant culture, which is
         distinguished by its own system of values, customs, norms, and traditions.
          A subculture does not oppose the dominant culture. It contains a number
          of values ​​of the dominant culture and adds to them new values ​​peculiar
           only to it.Anime fans have long been recognized as a special youth subculture.
            Indeed, it is possible to define all its main features:
special interests and values ​​(and everything is clear, this is anime, manga,
culture and history of Japan, collecting figurines, posters, drawing in the style of anime,
 creating fan fiction, etc.);
slang (a lot can be written about this, since anime slang is a separate layer of
 modern youth speech. In addition, many people use in their language barbarisms
  copied from the Japanese language, which replace the words "Hello" -"Konnichiva",
  "Thank you" - "Arigato", "All is well" - "Sayonara". Well, it is simply impossible
   not to mention "NO!", which can be used to express a wide variety of emotions);
demeanor. It is quite difficult to define a behavior common to all anime fans.
In general, teenage animists usually express their emotions more actively than
adult animists;
clothing and appearance. Sometimes by the tiniest little details of clothing
(a keychain on the phone in the form of an anime character, animeit is possible
to define an anime player. Not to mention the bags and t-shirts with the
 corresponding symbols, which immediately distinguish the anime artist from the crowd.
  Determining elements of an anime fan's appearance are also a suitable hairstyle,
   like that of a favorite character, or simply a look and color characteristic
   of anime or manga;
presence of informal groups and societies. Of course, these are clubs and other
associations of the anime community.

              <h2>Hajime Isayama</h2>
              <li>Hajime Isayama is a Japanese manga artist, who created the highly
                 popular manga series “Attack on Titan.” <br> <img class="rtt"
                 src="images/aott.jpg" height="160" alt=""> <img class="rtt"
                  src="images/iit00.jpg" height="160" alt=""><br>  It was first published
                 in 2009 and has been collected into 34 volumes as of June 2021.
                 The story centers around Eren Yeager and his childhood friends
                 Mikasa Ackerman and Armin Arlert, who join the military to fight
                  against the Titans, giant humanoid creatures who have forced

  <h2>Koyoharu Gotouge</h2>

    <br>Kimetsu no Yaiba, or Demon Slayer,
     started airing back in 2019 to critical acclaim by both long-time and new anime fans.

 highest-grossing anime film in the world, surpassing all of the other films
 by Miyazaki, Oda, and that of Toriyama’s as well.</li>
